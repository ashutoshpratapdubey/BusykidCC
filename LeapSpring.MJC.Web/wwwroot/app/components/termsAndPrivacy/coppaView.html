In order to create a child’s account, you must provide us with your child’s username, password, age and/or date of birth, and gender. While you provide us with personal information about your child, we will also collect information about your child’s activities within our Site or App in such a way that we are able to associate your child’s activities with his/her username or other identifier, such as an Internet protocol (IP) address. For more information about the information we collect automatically about users, please see the Information We Collect section in our <span class="link"><a href="#" ui-sref="privacypolicy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></span>.
